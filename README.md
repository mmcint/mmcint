### Hi there 👋

My name is Mike and I am a Computational Geoscientist and Data Scientist at Onward.

I'm passionate about geoscience and technology, and love when the two mesh. I's also a maintainer of the [awesome-open-geoscience](https://github.com/softwareunderground/awesome-open-geoscience) list. 

🔭 I’m currently working on new Onward Data Science Challenges. In my free time I am working on my personal fantasy football blog to prepare for the next season.

💬 Feel free to ask me about Geology 🪨, Geophysics 👨‍💻, and Fantasy Football 🏈

🌱 I’m currently learning [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)
