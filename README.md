### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mike and I am a Data Scientist and Computational Geoscientist with a decade of experience in the energy, insurance, and banking industries. 

I'm passionate about technology, and love when it meshes with my interests, like sports and geoscience. I's also a maintainer of the [awesome-open-geoscience](https://github.com/softwareunderground/awesome-open-geoscience) list.
