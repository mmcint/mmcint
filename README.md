### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mike and I am a Data Scientist and Computational Geoscientist with a decade of experience in the energy, insurance, banking, and finance industries.

I helped build the Geophysical Foundation Model while at ThinkOnward. You can checkout that model on [GitHub](https://github.com/thinkonward/geophysical-foundation-model/releases/tag/v1.0) and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/thinkonward/geophysical-foundation-model). This model is associated with the a [poster presented](https://imageevent.aapg.org/portals/26/abstracts/2024/4092088.pdf) at AAPG/SEG IMAGE 2024 Conference in Houston,Texas.

I'm passionate about technology, and love when it meshes with my interests, like sports and geoscience. I's also a maintainer of the [awesome-open-geoscience](https://github.com/softwareunderground/awesome-open-geoscience) list.
